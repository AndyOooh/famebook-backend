So - mainModule is deprecated- main returns undefined for me using ES6 (am I doing something wrong?)

what is current best practice for a global root directory?

See also: https://nodejs.org/dist/latest-v14.x/docs/api/esm.html#esm_import_meta_url
for ES6 filepath best practices.


// app.use(bodyParser.urlencoded({ extended: false })); //for data sent through a form
app.use(bodyParser.json()); //take form data and convert to json on the frontend first I guess

util/globals.js:
export const rootDir = path.resolve(path.resolve())
app.js:
// import { rootDir } from './util/globals.js';

First commit. Currently working on file upload from multiple fields with multer. README has many notes. Will add to github.
